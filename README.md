## Introduction
To inform you that my submission for the project task is incomplete. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Unfortunately, I had to attend a family wedding ceremony and was not able to complete the final stages of the project, including the dockerization and test case portions. Despite this, I am pleased to inform you that I have completed the development of the APIs for all three models.

I understand the importance of delivering complete and high-quality work and I regret that I was not able to meet the expectations for this task. I am committed to making things right and would be happy to work with you to resolve this issue.

Thank you for your understanding and I look forward to your response.
